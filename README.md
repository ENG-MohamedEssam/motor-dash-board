# Motor Dashboard using Atmega32
#### This is an embedded systems project that uses an Atmega32 microcontroller to create a motor dashboard system. The Atmega32 is a powerful microcontroller with a wide range of peripherals and features, making it a popular choice for embedded systems projects.

#### The project utilizes an LCD screen, a keypad and a motor to enable the user to control and monitor the motor's performance. The project has 3 main screen displays: the password screen, the main menu screen and the motor dashboard screen.

#### The password screen is the first screen that the user encounters. The system prompts the user to enter a password. If the password is entered incorrectly, the system will turn on the red LED and display "Wrong Input" on the LCD screen. After 3 failed attempts, the system will display "Access Denied" and will not allow any more tries.

#### If the password is entered correctly, the system will move to the next screen, which is the main menu screen. This screen has 2 options: "Motor Dashboard" and "Exit". If the user chooses the "Motor Dashboard" option, the system will move to the third screen, which is the motor dashboard screen. This screen has 4 options: "Clockwise", "Counter-Clockwise", "Stop" and "Return". The user can use these options to control the motor's rotation direction and stop the motor.

#### The project also demonstrates the ability to program the microcontroller to interpret the keypad inputs and perform the corresponding actions, and also the ability to work with low-level system features, such as the LCD screen and the keypad. 

### Additionally, the project has a demonstration video that you can find on the provided link.
